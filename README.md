# Automail System Enhancement Project

## Introduction

This project involves enhancing the Automail mail delivery system by integrating a charging capability into its robotic delivery process. The goal is to enable robots to charge tenants upon successful mail delivery, reflecting service fees and activity costs.

## Features

- Implementing a charge formula based on service fees and activity costs.
- Allowing priority delivery based on a charge threshold.
- Adding fault tolerance and ensuring consistent behavior with the original system when charge functionality is disabled.
